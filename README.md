# Anime Recommendation Engine

Contributor(s): Gael Blanchard
Requirements: Python(sklearn, pyspark, os)
Data: AnimeList, MovieLens100K, MovieLens20M

Objective:
Develop, test and evaluate a recommendation engine with pyspark on the animelist dataset.
- Given a user can we recommend titles they are likely to enjoy
- Given an anime can we recommend other anime that are like it

How it works:

Concepts Covered:
Cosine Similarity, Pearson's Correlation, Collaborative Filtering, Recommendation Engine, Stratified Sampling, Train-Test Spit

Going Further:
By applying sampling techniques such as [Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume16/chawla02a-html/chawla2002.html), we can deal with the common imbalanced data phenomena that is prevalent in data.
Using this methodology to develop recommendation engines for larger databases.
